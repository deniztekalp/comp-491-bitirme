Natural Language Guided Deep Reinforcement Learning


For the third progress meeting:
  The pong notebook is for the Deep Q-Learning implementation so far
  The bimodal embedding notebook is for the training of bimodal embeddings
  The other two .py files are tutorials we implemented while learning about reinforcement learning. 
  However, they are not our code for the project
